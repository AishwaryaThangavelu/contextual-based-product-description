The outer sleeve is different in very small ways and looks more costly than the inner box. Anyway, the directions say to apply to clean skin before the night cream. I should see results in 8 days. It went on nicely and it is a nice sized bottle for drops.'\n",

      " 'So, to try this out, I followed the directions, opened the LED part and removed the blue battery saver paper. Then I reassembled, making sure that the batteries were in the correct position. Then, I could not get the thing to turn on. I tried in different parts of my face, holding it there and nothing happened.'\n",
      " 'This product is a thicker than normal cream - but when you get some out, it is similar to a balm - without the instant melt of a balm. This spreads easily over your face. Got to say I like it. I put it over some other products I had tried. This is the winner.'\n",
      " \"Because of anti depressants I take, my eyes are typically dry and I have to use moisturizing drops. If a speck of dust or a piece of hair gets near my eyes, it feels like it is scratching my eyeball. So this is a blessing for my eyes. I spend a bit of time each evening wearing this. You do have to connect it to power, but that isn't an issue for me.\"\n",

      " 'This is a human hair wig made for women of color. They have used wigs for years and no how to color them and curl and straighten the hair properly. I will not be using it as a wig for me. I will be using it to make wigs for some of my valuable dolls so they can have a new look.'\n",
      " \"To me, it smells like it isn't fresh. It might be the shea butter or one of the oils or some other mystery ingredient. When you use it and wipe it off, it makes your lips feel dry and you will definitely need a lip moisturizer or lip mask.\"\n",
      " 'I like that this has floating ceramic tourmaline plates. I also like that it has a fast heat up. And I like that it has the recommended heat level for different types of hair. I especially like the automatic shut off after 60 minutes and the easy restart.'\n",

Leave overnight.<br />I love how this feels on my skin.'\n",

      " 'In the nicely packaged box, you get a brightening cleanser, a brightening toner, a brightening lotion, a brightening cream, a brightening eye cream and a brightening essence. The products are meant to be used together and you use them as instructed. The instructions are all in Chinese, so what they did for use who can only speak English, they have attached instructions in English on the back of the packaging. The box has shrink wrap so you are able to pull the directions away from the clear wrap and put it on your box. Hopefully, you do a better job and putting it on than I did. But it works.'\n",

I used this today and I had a good amount of cleaning to do on the head and brushing out the hairs. This is the most hairs I have ever been able to remove with an electric or chargeable razor. You can also wash your face with the scrubber and trim your sideburns and more. This is also waterproof. The instructions are all in Chinese, but you can see from the pictures what to do and how to lift the rotaries to brush the hairs out.\"\n",
      " 'This gel nail set comes with 6 different colors that they have themed as \"Love Spectrum\". The colors are quite nice. You will need to get a UV LED Lamp. You will also need to get the Lagunamoon Gel Nail Polish Soak Off UV LED Gel Base Coat and No Wipe Top Coat Gel Polish Set. All of these items can be purchased on Amazon. They recommend that you put on layers and each layer should be thin. Follow all instructions and you will have beautiful shiny nails.'\n",
      " \"I am on my second day of using this product. I have used other products - some work, some do nothing. I am hoping for the former on this. It has a very thin applicator brush so you can just line the upper part of your eyelashes and when dry, you can apply mascara. I haven't had any adverse reactions. I will know more as time goes on. It looks like my lashes are darker already, but that could be my wishful thinking.\"\n",
      " 'The needles in the eye microtip are not very long and they are very thin, so it is a breeze to go over your eye area and eyebrow area without pain and with ease. I want all of the needling attachment heads. These are the best I have used to date.'\n",
      " 'This is a wonderful tool. If you get that rough, callused skin on your heels, this is the most fantastic thing you will ever use. It works quickly and you can use it daily to keep that dry skin at bay. I love mine so much, I got one for my daughter. She used mine and loved it, so this is making a perfect gift for her! &#60;3'\n",

      " 'I love this foot buffer!. I would recommend anyone who gets one of these little babies to go with the rechargeable over the battery-operated. The rechargeable stays powerful and I can keep the power strong by using the cord on it at the same time. My heels are very dry and crack easily. This helps buff those rough areas easily and makes my feet smoother all over. Love it!']\n"
